    <p>
    Even if I managed to fall asleep for a little while, the gasping and rasping sounds 
    of my husbandâ€™s snoring woke me again and again. It was much worse than when our kids 
    were babies, because if the baby cried, it would only be for a little while and I could go back to sleep. 
    But this loud snoring never stopped! It kept me up almost the whole night!
